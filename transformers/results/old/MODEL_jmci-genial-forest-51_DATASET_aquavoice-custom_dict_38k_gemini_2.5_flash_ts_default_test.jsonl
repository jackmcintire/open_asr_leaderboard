think it will be after the initial leads right how they handle it and that is out of our control but i think i would bet that like if they can not do that if they can not get like if they they probably what i am trying to say is if they are really shit as in like you know they can not handle any leads they can not do consistent quality follow up quickly and all the things which are needed to convert a customer and probably pick up the phone and maybe even go in person and like actually sell if they can not do that then they will probably churn from our software anyway like if we are not seeing like cause we can do our bit of getting them the leads but ultimately like if they if they do not have the other parts i would argue that if we are charging a high price which i want to because i think there is the handholding which is needed in our market to compete and all the rest of it is that we have almost yeah there is nothing nothing we can do about that but we should commit we should say hey we basically do that we give a i guess we could just give a guarantee in general right like if they if they want their money back i do not care for whatever reason that is what what like we are essentially saying we are just like you know try our software out if it does not work for you we will give you your money back but i guess the 1st customer is a good way of tying it in and being able to explain the roi and making it more tangible for them to understand the value of the software in general so yeah that is what kind of how i was hoping but there might be some like smarter way but thinking about it i think it might just overcomplicate things cause then unless we are going for a fundamentally different model you know when i say that it is like literally like pay per pay per lead model but again they do not work in leads right they work in customers and so yeah i just think that we have just got to put our money where our mouth is basically to get people off the ground the other way of doing it is just charge less money right that is what a lot of saas does is like actually makes it more palatable upfront but then you miss whole groups of customers where i do actually think it is the pricing model it is not that they yeah if you take like lead generation it is like well yeah of course it is only applied to like tech companies not people because they again measure these things they have sales teams they just operate in a different way to like a coffee roaster or person now the other way to do it is you go for like a a shopify approach but shopify is interesting cause it is essentially their model is like a marketplace model say charge a commission on they make it easier start make charge card fees which is where probably a lot of their money comes from now as well so and they are high volume we are not high volume like shopify there will not be a sales process there will not be an onboarding so to me it kind of i think makes sense to just offer a guarantee based on yeah everything we know about the market and the fact they have got a problem that they are not used to spending cause i honestly feel that like you could justify way higher prices if if you can gua if you can guarantee it that is always the thing and they do not believe they do not believe that you can that is always the the problem right is that they are like okay this sounds good can see how this could work but for when it comes to pulling the trigger it is always like well you know for whatever it does not just quite feel right like if you do not spend that kind of money if you do not work in budget cycles and stuff like that then it just ends up feeling uncomfortable and feels like too big bigger risk and like you can only absorb so much in one demo as well and then you just end up making our sales cycle a lot more expensive so i would rather just say hey we give like a 2 month maybe is a better one than 3 month and we tie it to a way of them operating and we tie it to a certain amount of customers yeah i mean i am also not too bothered like i do not know if there is some way of doing this i am not too bothered if they do not or like if they get a new one new customer and they want to quit but that is again fine cause again we are month to month paying software so and when i say quit yeah cause i think the the the new customer is hard as well because it could be a new customer that is like a retail account or it is a low value account for them so i think maybe we just keep it super simple and we just say you know we basically say look we expect you to get your 1st couple of customers from this in the 1st few months we offer a 22 month or 3 month complete money back guarantee if that does not happen to do that you just have to follow this process and the process is you literally just have to add a certain amount of people per month and then if it gets to the end and they are like no do not want this i want my money back i think that is fine anyway the business is not going to be grown off of 2 months and then churn anyway so if it has not worked i would rather take give the money back and do something which allows us to be more bullish on the prices especially for a startup", "pred_text": "yeah like i think that i think i like the 1st customer guarantee like we can not say exactly a lot i think we will be after the

or bob like we can make really short aliases for doing all kinds of these calls just making them shorter which i mean mostly the human is going to benefit from because it is less stuff to read and when humans type it manually on the command line it is less to type which is very nice but otherwise i think we should just have one agent spawning and management and communications tool and perhaps we just call it agents and i think we can get away with making the 1st parameter the 1st positional parameter who you want to talk to so i am thinking of it like agents and then tell bob tell the reviewer slash the the a guy with the role of reviewer so it can be an agent like an agent template like we said bob is bob has configuration for wait let me check your yes your agent is yaml where it has a certain model what scaffolding to use a precise role and which working directory and potentially other things could have some custom prompts some additional system prompts could be anything right it has a predetermined it is a named configuration named agent configuration and it could even include like a specific state of configuration like a specific replayed or complete input up to a certain point so like it could reference any past conversation any branch any particular message so yeah like a named agent configuration could contain any of that and i am wondering if at that sense if we needed further distinction so a named agent configuration does not necessarily have to be currently running right like claude code does not have to be running with this and that and now i am thinking about so what is the distinction between if that particular configuration is currently running or not is that something we need to consider and then that kind of goes into ownership and i mean one actual instance can only process like can only have one person chatting with that agent instructing that agent at the time right an agent can generally only really unless we do some like tricks that allow a single instance of an agent to talk with multiple people in interleaved fashion or something so yeah this is just something help me think through this because i am not sure then a point about the p flag what i meant by making that optional is that we can just infer the right thing to do so we can see when it is when it is a human effectively calling it from an interactive session then we can just behave differently than if it is called from a non interactive session so we can infer the p flag and not require it so we do not have to document it and the agent cannot do anything wrong and the human if they want the p behavior they can add it then and i think we can even determine if a tool is being called in a pipe right i think that is also possible to determine automatically so even the human even using it as part of a pipe would not need to specify that is my understanding at least and i mean if the human had to specify it because it is being used in a pipe well they could live with that but the agent i think never needs to set that flag and so back to the cli description or cli design i think the 1st argument is always going to be something that we can identify as some kind of named i mean named context or it can be a role or it can be a model i do not know if there is anything else i guess it can identify the scaffolding as well so you could just say claude yeah even though it is a claude code scaffolding you could just say claude or amp yeah but you have to give one of those i mean that makes sense and we can make it we can just enforce that like 1st names or or like names for people or or you know animals and so on can be given to named configurations and then but you cannot like give a a role like reviewer some kind of cute alias name some kind of name that would be easy to mix up with the name of a named configuration and any named configuration cannot be cannot receive a name that is the name of a of a model or a model provider and stuff like that so we keep them fairly separate in terms of their etymology is that a good way of putting it so we just pick those names from very different buckets and i mean we have no control over the the model names more or less but we can give them good enough aliases inside of our context that these things can easily be inferred what they mean by just with just map lookups no no intelligence necessary and then the next thing is i think we can also get rid of new versus continue the sub commands because i believe what we can do is so if i am chatting with bob i think chances are extremely high that i just have a continuous conversation and perhaps i could instead have a flag like dash dash new or dash dash fresh or something that says okay give me a fresh context here and perhaps as part of the named configuration we can have something that says how full do we allow the context to get before on the next turn that agent returns the information that hey this context is getting full please consider like performance of this context is going to degrade please consider summarizing if necessary or establishing whatever kind of continuation you need or just starting a fresh context i think this is the default that i would see for for named agents and then for reviews i think i would handle it pretty much the same so perhaps for all of them so we could put the continue or c flag for explicitly saying yeah i definitely want to continue this just so you can be very explicit about that and a dash dash new or dash dash fresh context or i do not know something like that perhaps dash dash new flag for a new context so you can be explicit about that but i think we can get away with not even having to explicitly manage those things because so reviews are going to be short and there is very little risk of just keeping a context for way too long for different kinds of reviews and so and here is something that i wanted to say earlier that plays into this that i think is going to help us identify what to do with these conversations if it is if it is a continuation or if it is a fresh context that is being requested so basically we can also give the caller an identity so when agents is being called from the command line by a human then we know that so we give them like the the so in my name dennis as my like agent id the the owning or or calling agent id and if it is let us say an instance of claude code here running as a director then it is the director and with the current working directory so basically what did we call those things like everything that all of the attributes that can be part of a named configuration something like this no not all of those but enough of them that it pretty much uniquely identifies this instance this conversation yeah it has to identify this conversation and perhaps this branch perhaps down to branch this is what identifies that conversation and when something is then called from a branch a different branch of that conversation then the target conversation should be continued but should also branch otherwise the existing conversation should just be continued and so since most of the models have similar context sizes and we do not use like the really huge context size models as our drivers they are never going to be spawning long exchanges or they are never the drivers of our agentic system that means that our context windows will fill up relatively on par with each other and that means that we can get away with not even having to reset most of these other agent contexts so yeah i think we can we can just get away with using the caller agent is identification or the human is which in that case is very simple in the human is case yeah like literally it is the the human is username plus probably the context the sorry the current working directory yeah so we can just infer if we are supposed to continue or branch or start a fresh context and another important thing is that we want to auto generate really good names for each of those conversations and we want to generate an initial name and and not just names but actually ids and the id is like whatever identifies the source agent source conversation where this is spawned from and then an id made up of what identifies the the target conversation or .", "pred_text": "and here is some thinking around that namely

where you are having this issue it is limited in how far it can fill with blood at which point once it reaches kind of like a water balloon that can only fill so much right okay at which point it stops bleeding cause it tamponades itself it puts pressure on itself so so there is no by the ct scan the good news is with the contrast dye they did not see any active area of like active bleeding which is good okay yeah so now it is kind of a waiting game because we do not want to go back in there and stab it open and drain it because it is going to make it bleed more so unless it is expanding further which i was coming in to see if i could look at it but i am going to let you finish pumping and then maybe when you get to the room or something like that i can just take another look and i have a marker that i wanted to kind of just outline outline it so that we can have like a visual cue of like okay does it look like it is expanding is it stable and starting to shrink but i wanted to do that just so we can keep an eye on it okay so the bottom line is when it comes to like vulvar hematomas like this we leave them alone right eventually they are going to stop bleeding they are going to stop okay okay and then they are going to slowly reabsorb it is not going to be reabsorbed in like just a couple of days it is going to take probably a couple of weeks to fully reabsorb but that does not mean you stay here for the full couple of weeks right we just wait and make sure that we are going to just repeat your lab did they ever call you for labs yet i am not sure when they come in the last hour or so they have not come i am not sure i think they are like waiting 15 minutes like for something but i am not sure if it is an emergency or something 0 it must be my mom okay okay let me just make sure this is not an emergency 12nd hey what is up yeah okay i appreciate it okay bye sorry about that so let me just log in and see if they sent that yet if it is in process cause we basically the plan right now is to get you to a room keep your pain under control monitor the expansion of the hematoma follow your labs like every few hours like we will check it tonight and make sure it is stable and then maybe in the morning and make sure it is stable to make sure that you are not becoming anemic from the bleeding right and then if there is any concern that it is continuing to expand that is when we say okay maybe we should go ahead and go to the operating room for you under anesthesia kind of ex open it up explore it drain it and then see if we need to stitch and even if we find nothing to stitch but that is a really hard thing to do which is why it is the last resort okay only if it is expanding further okay we can use ice okay on that area to help like kind of soothe it and everything too pain control like i mentioned iv or oral pain control and then i think you can eat whatever you want i do not think there is a need for you to like not have anything by your mouth i do not i am not planning on taking you to the or knock on wood to the operating room yeah i do not want that either and the last thing is have you been able to pee i did sit you did and you let out urine yeah yeah urinating at all okay no no no no i think they put like a a catheter no 0 no what is it it is like a suction suction tube yeah suction i think we should do you was that because you felt like you is it hard for you to get on the toilet so you are peeing right now no it was not because like it was like 6 hours with the pain that i could not like like have a yeah okay it was it was like took me like a few minutes because i am trying my best but absolutely i do not i do not blame you cause i was going to say with a hematoma that size sometimes it literally blocks the urethra where you pee from that is good that you were able to pee on your own and they just suctioned it up but one thing we could consider doing is putting a foley catheter into the urethra but that i mean that itself is also uncomfortable but once it is in it will help drain your bladder and we would keep it in we try not to keep it in for more than like one or 2 days maximum but it can help keep your bladder like drain your bladder so that if you have an issue peeing i feel like i do not know we do not have any issue no i feel like with my medication i can try to go to the toilet okay okay that is fine but like right now it is because i was in so much pain that yes i did not want to risk myself okay in that case that is fine however if you have the urge to pee and you are in too much pain or feel like you can not let the urine out you need to let your nurse know right away and at that point we will put the foley catheter in okay because we do not want your bladder getting so full and this is very rare okay this is not going to happen to you we are going to get we are going to put the foley in before but if it gets super full i worry about your bladder getting overdistended and then not working properly you know and like not being able to push out urine so yeah but when i am yeah when you are like i am holding babies right now we had a baby sometime ago so i yeah have to hold baby for hours yeah exactly so yeah so if you are if you have the urge to pee and then you go and sit on the toilet and none comes out then we are going to have to put the foley catheter in is that okay okay i am so sorry i had that whole conversation and then what is your name my dear silvia silvia yeah how are you guys related friends friends okay thank you for basically we are all related family okay i am so glad for you being here thank you silvia she is my family too so okay beautiful yes could i ask you yes you mentioned we will see basically like we will check in to see and then you said like the recovery could take weeks but like and then it was it might get bigger or whatever how i guess you said check what does that mean as far as like timeline wise like every every few hours so i wanted you the last time the doctor i think came down to check was right before she came to see me to give me information about you around like 8 0 pm or something like that i think so i wanted to check it 7 she said 77 okay and it is almost it is it is a little past what is it 9 something it is 9 20 yeah so i want to check it like every 3 to 4 hours just to make sure it is not like expanding okay so i was going to check it well i was going to come check it now but i want you to finish pumping so maybe once you get transferred to the room the nurses i will have the nurses just call me when you get transferred so that i can come and just check it once you get to the room upstairs before you try to rest and everything okay and it basically starts slowly getting smaller yeah and what does like 3 yeah if it stops expanding then it starts getting smaller and what does the blood draining look like like honestly so it may drain from the biopsy site that is possible it may spontaneously start draining from there okay in which case we will monitor it and make sure it is not excessive right okay but otherwise usually what happens for a hematoma is it it is like caught in that that space right and it does not actually have many times it does not have an area to drain from okay and your enzymes in your body literally just eat up the old blood okay and then reabsorb it over time 0 wow that is amazing literally and that is why it takes so long exactly so it is going to get hard okay cause it is going to be like a hard old blood clot in there okay and when will we know if she can go home i guess good question so i am hoping in the next day or 2 but we want to make sure that you can pee normally that your pain is under control and that it is not expanding anymore and that your hemoglobin is stable it is the pain yeah i do not want to be at home cause they take care of a like a totally 3 month old baby totally and i do not want to be like totally carrying bags yeah absolutely yeah so we are just going to basically keep you until you are in a state where you can take care of yourself essentially okay i have another question i know that we do not have like like full answers yet but what can be the cause of this you know like so cause it is like so many like these different theories and it could be like the reaction to the like the i think it is a bloo i think it is blood stuck in the i think it is blood stuck in the in the baby based on the pictures that i saw because of the cut maybe it it is possible that you already had a small hematoma it is hard for me to say right cause i was not there during the initial of course exam but i have had for example i have had a patient who was postpartum who came to see me random right like it was like 4 or 6 weeks after she delivered her baby who was doing fine no issues and then she had a really hard poop one day and she tried to strain and she burst this little blood vessel in her perineum like you know the opening of the vagina right here and she had this hard like it looked purple like mass right there i do not know if that is what yours looks like cause i only go off of what the doctor like described okay but that is what happened to her it was this little hematoma and it was just like this little same thing that happened but much smaller and i just told her like i am not going to cut it it is a little hematoma maybe from straining or something like that pretty rare for that to happen right like all she did was strain to have a bowel movement and it just burst you know it was just it was frag a little blood vessel that just burst blood a little bit and then stopped and so i just told her you got to just do ice pain control and let it resorb right so it it may be related to something like that but it mostly made it yeah it seems like it but yeah there the so i do not know if that is what initially caused the little lump or whatever i do not think so because that is what i notice it yeah like when i start pushing i i feel something when i push yeah but nothing like the lump or the mass yeah yeah and i was let me just see here i was going to see what the cause it looks like that area is filled with like a substance like a like a like blood right on the ct scan and so that is why i do not think it is like just a skin tissue reaction from light i mean i think it is like just a hematoma a basic which is a collection of blood yeah okay yeah so that is my suspicion 0 yeah so let me see here yeah hema they the the radiologist suspected the same thing as well hematoma yeah but not after bleeding not after bleeding which is good and then you peed after the ct scan right yes you went pee after you used the bathroom after after okay good cause they said your bladder was pretty full on the ct scan and so that is why i was like ooh maybe she can not pee because it is blocking her pee hole so yeah makes sense i mean i did a pee since 11 0 am yeah and your hemoglobin is good they did check it at 9 0 pm when they came to get that lab test from you okay and it dropped by 2 points but it is still normal so cause you started at a good level yeah 14 right so another one yeah so i am going to recheck it in another i would say 2 to 3 hours okay when you probably once you get up to the room i am going to have them check it again okay okay to make sure it is not dropped yeah because it is like 11 0 and i yeah it should stabilize eventually i take pain medicine and all that yeah yeah but right now the pain is better after you got let us see what did they give you for pain control i want to check really quick so they gave you dilaudid which is good and corl and tylenol okay all right sounds good so we will continue those medications as well and you can just we will i will schedule the tylenol it will be oral tylenol like 1000 milligrams every 6 hours that i will schedule for you you can decline it if you are not in pain and then i will also schedule ibuprofen as well every 6 hours and then if you are having like 789 out of 10 pains very more severe pain despite taking the tylenol and ibuprofen just ask your nurse cause you are also going to have orders for like oxycodone like a narcotic that is more heavy hitting okay to control your pain okay okay so i guess i have that yeah so we definitely want to just recheck your labs in another couple of hours and order but the point is yeah like why so much like like 2 points i mean for me well like cause your body is kind of you have also got did you get fluids you have also gotten like some fluids too so there is a little dilution in there too as a factor cause the iv fluids are going to like dilute your blood as well and like the the hemoglobin too so you definitely lost some blood into that hematoma and there is some fluid dilution there but you are not you are not even anemic yet i hope you never become anemic no but you are nowhere near no it is just like definitely ways between the drop the drop yeah is so like yeah yeah yeah me too and that is why i want to check again of course of course yeah yeah so okay anytime okay okay and then yeah my only concern about like well the nurse said give me this back in but i i gave 10% my mail and put it in my room but yeah no absolutely i know that i take i will fill you more in the room but yeah yeah yeah and is there no way that this room could be on this floor i know it is hot in here huh it is super hot wow there is no thermostat next to you is there behind that door there is sure not really and then yeah i know i do not know i do not think they have one in this sometimes they do but i do not think this one has one i am sorry my dear that is okay do you want the astronauts to get some like ice packs to like put on it if you really really want no i have i have some they have some that i carry with me as soon as we have a bed for you you are going to transfer to another room okay yes you are not going to be here all night okay nice at least yeah absolutely okay my dear so i will send that repeat lab work and then they are call", "pred_text": "you know it can pool right in the tissue and that is kind of space in the lower luckily in the area where you are having this issue it is limited in how far it can fill the blood at which point once it reads kind of like a water balloon that is only filled so much right at which point it stops bleeding because it is having off itself it puts pressure on itself so"}
